                    Hello! My name is Ben.<br> I am a student and freetime photographer. <br> I currently in a city near Munich in Germany.<br>
                    In my freetime I like to code, take & edit photos and design stuff.<br> Sometimes I also walk through Munich and drink 1-2 coffees.

                    I dont know if you call this hobbies, but <br>
                    I will tell u the stuff that I like to do.<br>
                    I like to play minecraft on chill nights. <br>
                    What I also like to do is to sit outside and relax to the rain. <br>
                    I also like to lay down on the field and watch the sky and <br>
                    clouds at daytime and the stars and moon at nightime. <br>
                    Sometimes I also like to code and design stuff. <br>
